        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial advancements were made possible with all the ground-breaking
        innovations in automation, robotics, and mechanical engineering. Engineering animations are now bringing
        advanced tech to the world in the most engaging way. Engineering animations are graphical
        representations of mechanical systems and processes that are used to illustrate how they function. These
        animations can be used in a variety of contexts, such as in educational materials, engineering
        simulations, and marketing materials. There’s so much more in the area; read about the 8 things you need
